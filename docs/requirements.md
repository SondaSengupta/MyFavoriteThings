#Objective
The purpose of this exercise is to get a basic understanding of your skill level, how you organize your code, and how you make coding decisions.

##Instructions
Using the Bootstrap 3 framework for structure and styling, build a one-page, responsive site about yourself or your favorite hobby.
- Please do not use CDN links, as we occasionally have network issues with some external sites.
- We understand that in development, there are many schools of thought when it comes to coding best practices and that those ideas are constantly evolving. No need to overthink if you are coding “the right way.” We are looking for standard web best practices and the ability to explain coding decisions made.
- This position is more focused on coding rather than design skills. The final product should look nice, but doesn’t need to be too complex or have the latest cutting edge styling.
- Feel free to use placeholder text (such as your favorite version of Loreum Ipsum) and images (such as http://placehold.it/).
- Feel free to add comments within the code or attach a text document to explain any decisions made that may be of interest.

##Build Page Checklist
Please include the following items in your code:
- Bootstrap 3 library for structure and styling
- A navigation bar
- Multiple headings to show use of the HTML header hierarchy
- A section with three pieces of content that displays as one column on mobile and expands to three inline columns on desktop
- At least one button
- At least one glyphicon (the icons available in Bootstrap) and add a hover effect
- Some content in an aside or sidebar element
- An address and phone number (doesn’t have to be real contact information)
- Include one Bootstrap 3 component:
- Pick one of these three: Carousel, Modal, or Collapse
- Tweak something in your chosen component, such as: Change the default speed of the carousel, change the default fade effect of the modal or collapse
- One feature of a the Less or Sass language: Variable, Mixin, Import

##Exercise Submission
Completed projects can be submitted in one of two ways:
- Online repository (such as GitHub or BitBucket)
- Zip files (where files are all connected and can be viewed in browser from an index page); so if libraries are used, include them in the submitted zip file.
Submit the link to your project or the zip file to the same email address that sent you the test.
